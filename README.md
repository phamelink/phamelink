Hi, my name is Philip Hamelink and I come from Geneva, Switzerland. I'm 23 years old and I currently have a Bachelor in communications systems at EPFL.
My interests include IoT, web development (full-stack), ethical hacking and cryptography, which I plan on studying during my Master.

My repositories all contain small projects I did in my own free time or during my studies at EPFL. All code is strictly my own or co-authored with classmates.

I enjoy learning about new technologies, and the ones I consider myself proficient in are C, Go, Python, Java, Scala, and VHDL. I also do some part-time work developping web applications in Node JS and React.

Feel free to contact me if you want to get in touch @philip_hamelink on twitter or by email philip.hamelink@gmail.com
